The default page should be a list of existing invoices. This page should have a button for creating a new invoice.
The invoice form should support selecting an existing Customer
The invoice form should make it easy to browse and add existing Products (you should be able to add any number of products)
When a Product is added there should be a way to edit the quantity
There should be a place to enter a discount for the invoice (a percentage discount)
At the bottom of the page you should show a dynamically calculated invoice total.
This total should take into account the quantity and price of each product and the invoice discount

As changes are made on the invoice form they should be automatically saved through the API (don't require use of a Save button)
When you are done, please zip up the whole app directory with dependencies and upload it below.
